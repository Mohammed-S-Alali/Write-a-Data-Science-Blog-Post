## Project Motivation
Stackoverflow is a platform where developers from around the world share their coding questions & answers. Also, it is a community where companies share their jobs and individuals can build their teams.

Thus, I have used the survey of Stackoverflow developers Dataset in 2017 for this project as a part of the Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program. To illustrate, the dataset covers many aspects of developers like educational background, demographic, technical experiences and so on.

The following questions are the source of motivation to work on this project:
- How many developers are in each formal education?
- How is the StackOverflow Satisfaction for developers who are non-IT graduates?
- What is the most professional for the developers?

# Libraries
I have used these libraries in Python to complete this project by Jupyter Notebook:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Math

# File Descriptions
- Project 1 - Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2017.ipynb is a jupyter notebook that includes data understanding and data preparation, questions and answer with explanations and visualisations.
- survey_results_public.csv is an original dataset for the project.
- dataframe_project1.csv is the customized dataset to answer the questions.
